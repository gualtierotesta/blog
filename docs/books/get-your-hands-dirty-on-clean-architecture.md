**Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture**

<br/>

As developers, we organize our application code in classes and packages/modules. 

There are several ways to compose the code. A popular approach is the "three-tiered" architecture where the logic is divided in presentation, business and data layers. See link #1.

Alternative architectures are the "hexagonal" or "port/adapters" (see link #2) and R. Martin's Clean Architecture (link #3).

There are books which explain the architectures benefits and downsides. Among them, I suggest R. Martin's "Clean Architecture" book. 

On the other hand, Tom Hombergs' book complements these theoretical books showing how to implement the architectures using significant examples in Java.

The author explains:

* how to organize code in packages
* how to interface the logic between different application layers
* how to pass and map data object through layers

All examples are clear and well documented.

I've personally found quite useful the explanation of the possible data mapping strategies.

I highly suggest Tom Hombergs' "Get your hands dirty on clean architecture" book.
