**NOTE**: the second edition of this book has been published on March 2022 with ISBN 978-1801818964. This review is for the first edition.

This book is a nice read and a great resource. Five stars.

The devops concepts, tools and methodologies are well explained and introduced smoothly and logically. The author describes, with practical examples and clear explanations, all the topics related to the devops world:

* Git ops
* Infrastructure as a code
* Pipelines
* Continuous integration
* Continuous delivery
* Testing and quality checks
* Security
* Containers

In the different chapters, many tools are introduced and used in simple but realistic examples. 

The book examples are available on a dedicated [repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning_DevOps) on GitHub. 

There are also many videos which complement the book descriptions. They are linked in the book and available on a dedicated [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeLcvrwLe186ifTQ3s-wEeayiEg-_Ev8j) on YouTube.

The book is not (and it could not be) a reference for all devops tools and methodologies so every chapter ends with a useful list of links to additional resources that help the reader increase the knowledge on the specific topic.

This book is highly recommended.
