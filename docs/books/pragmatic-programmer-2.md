<br/>

Twenty years ago, the first edition of this book was fundamental to growing a new generation of software programmers.
This new revision has been updated to be aligned with how the software development has evolved.
A "pragmatic" programmer is a programmer who knows how to code (several chapters are dedicated to coding and software architectures) but is also able to work in a team and with the customer, contributing to the project's success.
The book contains several suggestions and tips on how to behave as a human being, a programmer and a member of a project.
It is not easy to read because most chapters are dense with concepts, ideas and suggestions, nevertheless, I firmly suggest it to everybody who wants to improve as a professional programmer.
My preferred phrase from the book: "Testing, design, coding - it's all programming".
