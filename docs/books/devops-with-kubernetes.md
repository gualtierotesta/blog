<br/>

DevOps and Kubernetes are prevalent topics nowadays.

This 2017 book by Packt Publishing wants to explain DevOps using containerised platforms, especially Kubernetes.

The first chapter is a very quick tour of the foundation of the DevOps methodology: micro-services, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as a code...

The second chapter describes what the containers are and how to use Docker, the dockerfiles and the docker-compose command.

The central part of the book is on Kubernetes, its resources, how to deploy and monitor our applications on Kubernetes, and how we configure and manage a Kubernetes cluster.

The final chapters are on AWS and Google Cloud offerings and how to implement a Kubernetes cluster on them.

The book could have been a good overview of the DevOps approach using Kubernetes but it is affected by one negative aspect: the book's English is not good, there are several grammar errors and the reading is sometimes not easy. This is somehow surprising for a UK-based publisher.

**Important**: there is a second edition of the book, published in 2019 (ISBN 978-1789533996). I expect the new edition will also cover some more recent DevOps concepts like, for example, the GitOps approach.
