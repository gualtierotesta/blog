# VSCode

*Last update: 19 Jan 2025*

## .gitignore configuration

The files generated by VSCode should be excluded (ignored) from the repo except the file that contains the recommended extensions for the project. This file is named `extensions.json`.

`.gitignore` fragment:

```text
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
```

The first line excludes all VSCode files, the second line re-enables the file with the recommended extensions.

## Recommended extensions file

The recommended extensions for the project can be saved in the project `extensions.json` file. All members of the team working on the project will be suggested by VSCode to install that extensions.

The content of the file is the following:

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        "extension1-id",
        "extension2-id",
        ....
    ]
}
```

Please note that the extensions are identified by their ID which can be found in the extension page as Identifier.
